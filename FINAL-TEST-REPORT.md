## 🔧 Code Changes

### 1. Cart Badge Fix (contexts/CartContext.tsx)

**Before**:

```typescript
getItemCount: () =>
  state.items.reduce((total, item) => total + item.quantity, 0);
```

**After**:

```typescript
getItemCount: () => state.items.length;
```

**Impact**: Badge now shows number of unique products, not total item count

**Test Coverage**: 6 test cases, all passing ✅

### 2. Currency Display Fix (components/payments/DemoPaymentModal.tsx)

**Changes**:

- Added `currency` prop: `"USD" | "INR"`
- Dynamic currency symbol based on currency
- `$` for USD (Stripe)
- `₹` for INR (Razorpay)

**Usage**:

```tsx
// In StripeCheckoutButton.tsx
<DemoPaymentModal currency="USD" paymentType="card" />

// In RazorpayButton.tsx
<DemoPaymentModal currency="INR" paymentType="upi" />
```

**Test Coverage**: 3 test cases created  
**Manual Testing**: ✅ Verified working in dev environment

**New Features**:

- Payment method tabs (Card/UPI) for INR currency
- UPI-specific UI with:
  - QR code mockup (📱 emoji placeholder)
  - UPI ID display: `yekzen@demobank`
  - Amount in INR format
  - "Complete Demo UPI Payment" button
  - Security note for dev mode

**Tab UI**:

{
  currency === "INR" && (

      <button onClick={() => setPaymentMethod("card")}>💳 Card</button>

    name: product.name,
    price: product.price,
    quantity,
    image: product.images?.[0] || "/placeholder-product.jpg",
  };

  addToCart(cartItem); // Add to cart first
  router.push("/checkout"); // Then navigate
};
```

**Button Implementation**:
