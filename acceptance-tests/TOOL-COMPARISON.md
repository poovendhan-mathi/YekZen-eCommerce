## 🏆 Winner: Playwright

### Why Playwright for YekZen?

#### ✅ **Technical Alignment**

1. **TypeScript Native**

   - Your project uses TypeScript
   - Type-safe test code
   - Better IDE support (autocomplete, refactoring)

2. **Next.js Optimized**

   - Designed for modern frameworks
   - Handles SSR/CSR gracefully
   - Fast page loads

3. **Modern Architecture**
   - Auto-waiting (no flaky `sleep()` calls)
   - Browser contexts (isolated tests)
   - Parallel execution out-of-box

#### ✅ **Developer Experience**

1. **Amazing Debugging**

   ```bash
   # UI Mode - visual test runner
   npx playwright test --ui

   # Debug mode - step through tests
   npx playwright test --debug

   # Trace viewer - time-travel debugging
   npx playwright show-trace trace.zip
   ```

2. **Code Generation**

   ```bash
   # Auto-generate tests by recording
   npx playwright codegen http://localhost:3000
   ```

3. **Rich Assertions**
   ```typescript
   await expect(page).toHaveURL("/cart");
   await expect(element).toBeVisible();
   await expect(element).toHaveText("Success");
   ```

#### ✅ **Already in Your Project**

```bash
# Check package.json
cat package.json | grep playwright
# Likely already installed!

# Check config
ls playwright.config.ts
# Config file already exists!
```
