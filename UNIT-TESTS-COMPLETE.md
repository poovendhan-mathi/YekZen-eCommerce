## 🔧 Test Configuration

All tests are configured to work with:

- **Jest** - Test runner
- **React Testing Library** - Component testing
- **TypeScript** - Type safety in tests
- **Mocked Firebase** - No real database connections
- **Isolated Environment** - No side effects between tests

---

## 📝 Next Steps

Now that unit tests are complete:

1. **Run Tests Locally**

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

2. **Check Coverage**

   ```bash
   npm test:coverage
   ```

   - Target: >90% coverage for new code

3. **Fix Any Failures**

   - Review error messages
   - Update implementation if needed
