## üöÄ How to Use the New Seed File

### Option 1: Run the large seed manually (while Firebase Emulators are running)

```bash
node scripts/seed-large.js
```

### Option 2: Use the helper script

```bash
./scripts/run-large-seed.sh
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:

- The emulators MUST be running first (port 8080 and 9099)
- The seed script will **clear existing products** and add the new 56 products
- This ensures clean data without duplicates

---

## üìã Complete Setup Instructions

1. **Stop the current app** (if running): Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal

2. **Start fresh with more products**:

   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Start emulators
   firebase emulators:start

   # Terminal 2: Run large seed (in a different terminal)
   node scripts/seed-large.js

   # Terminal 3: Start Next.js
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **OR use the all-in-one command** (if start-dev.sh still uses old seed):

   ```bash
   # Start emulators
   firebase emulators:start &

   # Wait 5 seconds
   sleep 5

   # Run large seed
   node scripts/seed-large.js

   # Start Next.js
   npm run dev
   ```

## üêõ Known Issues (If Any)

### Firebase Config

- There was a duplicate `useEmulator` variable declaration

### Cart not working?

1. Check browser console

### Categories not filtering?

1. Check that category names match in:
   - Seed data (`category` field)
   - Products page categories array
