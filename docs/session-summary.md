  - 2 user accounts (admin + regular user)
  - Product categories: audio, wearables, computers, gaming, cameras
- ✅ Successfully seeded Firebase emulator
- ✅ All products displaying correctly

### 3. User Accounts Created

- Email: admin@yekzen.com
- Password: admin123456
- Role: admin

**Regular User:**

- Email: user@yekzen.com
- Password: user123456
- Role: user

### 4. Firebase Products Service Fixed

- ✅ Updated `getProductsByCategory()` for consistent return format
- ✅ Updated `getFeaturedProducts()` with logging
- ✅ Updated `searchProducts()` for better results
- ✅ Products now loading from Firestore in real-time

### 5. Animation & Styling Improvements

- ✅ Enhanced Header navigation with premium hover effects:
  - Gradient background on hover
  - Shimmer effect animation
  - Smooth scale transitions
  - GPU-accelerated transforms
- ✅ Updated `globals.css` with performance optimizations:
  - GPU acceleration classes
  - Hardware-accelerated transforms
  - Shimmer effect utilities
  - Reduced motion support for accessibility
- ✅ Created `lib/animation-config.js` with optimized Framer Motion configs
- ✅ All animations using `will-change` and `transform3d` for 60fps performance

### 6. Development Workflow

- ✅ Created `start-dev.sh` script for easy startup
- ✅ Updated `package.json` with new scripts:
  - `npm run emulator` - Start Firebase emulators only
  - `npm run seed` - Seed data to emulator
  - `npm run start:dev` - Start everything at once
- ✅ Created comprehensive `DEVELOPMENT.md` guide

### 7. Current Running Services

✅ Firebase Emulator UI: http://localhost:4000
✅ Firestore: localhost:8080
✅ Auth: localhost:9099
✅ Next.js App: http://localhost:3000

## 🔧 Technical Improvements
