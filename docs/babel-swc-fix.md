# Babel/SWC Conflict Resolution

## Issue

Next.js was showing an error:

```
"next/font" requires SWC although Babel is being used due to a custom babel config being present.
```

## Root Cause

- Custom `babel.config.js` file was present in the project root
- Next.js 14+ uses SWC (Speedy Web Compiler) by default for better performance
- `next/font` optimization requires SWC and cannot work with Babel
- The presence of any Babel config file causes Next.js to fall back to Babel

## Solution

**Removed the custom Babel configuration file** because:

1. **Not needed for tests**: The project uses `next/jest` which automatically handles Babel configuration for Jest testing
2. **Better performance**: SWC is significantly faster than Babel
3. **Full compatibility**: SWC supports all the features we need

### Files Removed

- `babel.config.js` (originally created for Jest, but unnecessary with next/jest)

### Alternative Approaches (Not Used)

If custom Babel configuration was absolutely necessary, we could have:

1. Removed `next/font` imports and used standard CSS fonts
2. Created environment-specific Babel config (test-only)
3. Used Next.js 13 or earlier (not recommended)

## Additional Fixes

### 1. Missing AnimatedTooltip Export

**Issue**: ProductCard.jsx was importing `AnimatedTooltip` which wasn't exported from `MicroInteractions.jsx`

**Solution**: Added the `AnimatedTooltip` component to `MicroInteractions.jsx`:

```jsx
export const AnimatedTooltip = ({
  children,
  content,
  position = "top",
  className = "",
}) => {
  // Component implementation with motion animations
  // Supports top, bottom, left, right positioning
  // Includes arrow pointer
};
```

### 2. Cart Undefined Error in Header

**Issue**: `cart.items` was throwing "Cannot read properties of undefined"

**Solution**: Added optional chaining and default value:

```jsx
// Before:
const cartItemsCount = cart.items.reduce(
  (total, item) => total + item.quantity,
  0
);

// After:
const cartItemsCount =
  cart?.items?.reduce((total, item) => total + item.quantity, 0) || 0;
```

## Verification

### Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

✅ Server starts successfully without errors
✅ No Babel/SWC warnings
✅ Font optimization working

### Tests

```bash
npm test
```

✅ Tests run successfully with `next/jest` handling Babel automatically

## Benefits of the Fix

1. **Faster compilation**: SWC is 20x faster than Babel
2. **Better font optimization**: `next/font` fully functional
3. **Reduced bundle size**: Automatic font optimization and CSS inlining
4. **Simplified configuration**: No manual Babel config needed
5. **Future-proof**: Aligns with Next.js 14+ best practices

## Next.js SWC Features Now Enabled

- ✅ Font optimization with `next/font`
- ✅ Faster refresh during development
- ✅ Faster production builds
- ✅ Minification with SWC
- ✅ Styled JSX compilation
- ✅ React Server Components optimization
