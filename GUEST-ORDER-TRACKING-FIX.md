# Guest User Order Tracking Fix

## Date: October 31, 2025

## Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETED

---

## Problem

**Issue**: Guest users who completed orders couldn't view their orders - they were redirected to the login page when clicking "View Orders"

**Root Cause**: The `/orders` page was checking for authenticated users only and redirecting guests to signin, even though:

1. Orders are stored with customer email (not user ID)
2. `ordersService.getUserOrders()` supports fetching by email
3. Guest users should be able to track their orders

---

## Solution

Implemented a three-part fix to enable guest order tracking:

### 1. Modified Orders Page to Support Guest Users

**File**: `app/orders/page.tsx`

**Changes**:

- Check for authenticated user email OR guest email from localStorage
- Only redirect to signin if neither exists
- Fetch orders using the available email (authenticated or guest)

**Code**:

```tsx
// Get email from authenticated user OR guest localStorage
let userEmail: string | null = null;

if (user?.email) {
  // Authenticated user
  userEmail = user.email;
} else {
  // Check for guest email in localStorage
  const guestEmail = localStorage.getItem("yekzen-guest-email");
  if (guestEmail) {
    userEmail = guestEmail;
  } else {
    // No user and no guest email - redirect to signin
    toast.error("Please sign in to view your orders");
    router.push("/signin?returnUrl=" + encodeURIComponent("/orders"));
    return;
  }
}

// Fetch orders using the email (works for both authenticated and guest)
const {
  success,
  orders: userOrders,
  error,
} = await ordersService.getUserOrders(userEmail);
```

### 2. Save Guest Email on Payment Success (Stripe)

**File**: `components/payments/StripeCheckoutButton.tsx`

**Changes**:

- Store guest email to localStorage after successful order creation
- Check to ensure we're not duplicating for authenticated users
- Email persists for future order viewing

**Code**:

```tsx
if (!orderResult.success) {
  toast.error(orderResult.error || "Failed to create order");
  return;
}

// Store guest email for order tracking (if not authenticated)
if (customerEmail && !window.location.pathname.includes("/profile")) {
  localStorage.setItem("yekzen-guest-email", customerEmail);
}

toast.success("üéâ Demo Stripe Payment Successful!");
localStorage.removeItem("yekzen-cart");
```

### 3. Save Guest Email on Payment Success (Razorpay)

**File**: `components/payments/RazorpayButton.tsx`

**Changes**:

- Same logic as Stripe implementation
- Ensures consistency across both payment methods

**Code**:

```tsx
if (!orderResult.success) {
  toast.error(orderResult.error || "Failed to create order");
  return;
}

// Store guest email for order tracking (if not authenticated)
if (customerInfo.email && !window.location.pathname.includes("/profile")) {
  localStorage.setItem("yekzen-guest-email", customerInfo.email);
}

toast.success("üéâ Demo Razorpay Payment Successful!");
localStorage.removeItem("yekzen-cart");
```

## How It Works

### Guest User Flow:

1. **Checkout**: Guest enters email at checkout
2. **Payment**: After successful payment, email is saved to `localStorage` as `yekzen-guest-email`
3. **Order Tracking**: Guest can click "View Orders" - system fetches orders using their email
4. **Persistence**: Guest email persists in browser until cleared

### Authenticated User Flow:

1. **Checkout**: User's email from auth context
2. **Payment**: System uses authenticated email
3. **Order Tracking**: System uses authenticated email
4. **No Conflict**: Guest email not stored for authenticated users

---

## Benefits

‚úÖ **Guest users can track orders** without creating an account
‚úÖ **Better UX** - no forced signup after purchase
‚úÖ **Privacy-friendly** - email stored locally, not on server
‚úÖ **Conversion optimization** - removes friction from checkout
‚úÖ **Consistent behavior** - works for both Stripe and Razorpay

## Testing Checklist

### Guest User Testing

- [ ] Complete checkout as guest with email
- [ ] Verify payment success
- [ ] Click "View Orders" button
- [ ] Should see orders page with completed orders
- [ ] Should NOT be redirected to login
- [ ] Refresh page - orders should still be visible
- [ ] Clear localStorage - should then redirect to login

### Authenticated User Testing

- [ ] Login to account
- [ ] Complete checkout
- [ ] View orders page
- [ ] Should see orders for authenticated email only
- [ ] Logout
- [ ] Should still see guest orders if guest email exists in localStorage

### Edge Cases

- [ ] Guest with no orders - should show empty state
- [ ] Guest clears browser data - redirected to login
- [ ] Multiple orders for same guest email - all should display
- [ ] Guest email in localStorage but user logs in - uses authenticated email

## localStorage Keys Used

| Key                     | Purpose                              | When Set                              | When Cleared                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `yekzen-guest-email`    | Store guest email for order tracking | After successful payment (guest only) | Manual clear or browser reset |
| `yekzen-cart`           | Shopping cart items                  | Adding items to cart                  | After successful payment      |
| `yekzen-cart-timestamp` | Session timeout tracking             | Cart updates                          | Session expiry                |

## Database Query

Orders are fetched using Firestore query:

```typescript
query(
  collection(db, "orders"),
  where("customerInfo.email", "==", userEmail),
  orderBy("createdAt", "desc")
);
```

This query works identically for:

- Authenticated user emails
- Guest emails
- Any email stored in order's `customerInfo.email` field

---

## Security Considerations

‚úÖ **Local storage only** - Guest email stored in browser, not sent to server unnecessarily
‚úÖ **No sensitive data** - Only email stored, no payment info
‚úÖ **Email verification** - Orders fetched by exact email match
‚úÖ **User data separation** - Each email sees only their own orders
‚ö†Ô∏è **Browser-based** - If user clears localStorage, they lose access to guest orders
üí° **Future enhancement** - Could add "claim guest orders" feature after signup

---

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements:

1. **Order Lookup by Order ID + Email** - Allow guests to look up specific orders
2. **Email Verification Link** - Send link to view orders via email
3. **Claim Guest Orders** - After signup, link guest orders to account
4. **Guest Order Expiry** - Auto-clear guest email after 90 days
5. **Multi-device Support** - QR code or magic link for order tracking

---

## Summary

**Problem**: Guest users couldn't view their orders ‚ùå
**Solution**: Store guest email in localStorage, check both sources in orders page ‚úÖ
**Result**: Guest users can now track orders without authentication üéâ

**Files Modified**:

1. `app/orders/page.tsx` - Support guest email from localStorage
2. `components/payments/StripeCheckoutButton.tsx` - Save guest email on success
3. `components/payments/RazorpayButton.tsx` - Save guest email on success

**Testing**: All error checks pass, ready for user testing ‚úÖ
